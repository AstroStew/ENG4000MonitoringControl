# ENG 4000 (Capstone Project) Monitoring Control 

The Code presented in this repository is used to control an Arduino based monitoring system. Objectives are to detect the movement of a launched golf ball, capture an image and save it, then send it back to the computer.


When running the entire system, the code here will be used jointly with MATLAB code (being developed by Team Member Josh) to calculate the speed and trajectory of the launched Golf Ball. 

### Components To be Used
- Arduino Uno
- Serial Camera

### Notes
- This Code is currently a work in progress and will be developed in the following months (Jan 2021 to April 2021)
- Local Connections between the computer and Arduino will be attempted first (option 1 in block diagram) then remote connections will tried.
